# HW2_WebApplication

## Description
This is a sample website of my resume. Bootstrap is used as a CSS framework, and all of my work is based on a template from bootstrap.
The URL is:

www.myawesomeresume.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com


## Facebook Login and Logout
As the homework required, login module is added in this application. I select Facebook login module since it seems prevalant. This one works fine. When you login your Facebook account or have done that before, your webbrowser will redirect to the main page. On the other side, if you logout, it will jump back to login page.
What's more, if you try to access to main page by typing in URL of index.html without login, you are unable to do that.

## Hosting a Static Website
Since I hope to know something more about AWS, I posted this webpage on AWS as a bucket. Here is the tutorial link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9NbuTcos18.

## How to test this web page?
It is quite simple. As a regular webpage, what you need to do is open this address in a webbrowser:
www.myawesomeresume.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com.
